        <p>While our specialties are DNS and Email, we are also involved in a lot of really cool things, which we want to make available to you. That is why we have the Dyn Playground, which includes projects of all sorts including labs, third party examples (like how our stuff can work with Route 53 or Puppet, etc.), and “science projects.” However, since this is not our specialty, this is unsupported, so as a rule the code is “as is.” This doesn’t mean that we’re not available to answer a question, however, we don’t guarantee that this is going to work since other vendors update versions and libraries without telling us. Feel free to use any or all of the code though. And have some fun.</p>
